When evaluating options, consider the following factors:</p><p><strong>Level of Care Required</strong>: Determine whether the patient needs basic transportation or medical monitoring during transit.</p><p><strong>Staff Qualifications</strong>: Ensure the service employs properly trained staff with appropriate certifications for the level of care needed.</p><p><strong>Vehicle Fleet</strong>: Check that the company maintains well-equipped, clean vehicles that meet or exceed safety standards.</p><p>The right transportation partner will not only provide safe transit but will also treat patients with dignity and respect throughout their journey.</p>"
